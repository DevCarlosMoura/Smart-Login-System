# 🔐 Access Control System – Python Project

This is a simple yet functional **Access Control System** built with Python. The system simulates a basic login and registration flow, including a help page for forgotten credentials — all implemented **without using external libraries**.

## 📜 Features

- 👤 **Login System** – Validate user access with username and password.
- 📝 **User Registration** – Create a new user directly from the terminal.
- ❓ **Help Page** – Guide users who forgot their login or password.
- 🔒 **Secure Access** – Password input hidden from screen (without `getpass`).
- 🧹 **Exit Option** – Clean system termination with a friendly message.

## 🚀 Project Goals

This project was created as part of my programming learning journey. The focus was:
- Practicing logic and conditionals in Python
- Improving terminal interaction with users
- Simulating a real-world use case with limited tools (no imports)

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Open the terminal and run:

```bash
